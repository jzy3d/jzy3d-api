/** An {@link Selectable} object is supposed to be able to compute its projection
 * on the screen according to the {@link Camera} settings (viewport, viewpoint, etc).
 * 
 * The {@link View} provides a mean to update the projection of all {@link Selectable}
 * held by the scene's {@link Graph}. Indeed, interaction sources such as an
 * {@link AWTAbstractMouseSelector} are supposed to call {@link view.project()}
 * to query an update of all {@link Selectable} objects' projections.
 * 
 * Projection implementation is rather fast but one should consider projecting only
 * when required, i.e. when the actual scene's Graph projection changes, which is:
 * - when view point changes
 * - when view scaling changes
 * - when the objects data (shape) changes
 * 
 * So the user is responsible of handling appropriate calls to view.project()
